### Introduction
Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock is a fun game for both adults and children.<br>
It is based upon the original centuries-old game of ***Rock-Paper-Scissors***.
<br><br>To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)
> ***Rock-Paper-Scissors*** is an [intransitive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intransitive_game) hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). 

Therefore, this version of the game, ***Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock*** incorporates two new shapes namely Lizard and Spock.
<br>To quote [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors)
>One popular five-weapon expansion is ***"rock paper scissors Spock lizard"***, invented by [Sam Kass and Karen Bryla](http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html), which adds "Spock" and "lizard" to the standard three choices. "Spock" is signified with the Star Trek Vulcan salute, while "lizard" is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a [2005 article in The Times of London](https://web.archive.org/web/20100531231332/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article1080425.ece) and was later the subject of an [episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_episodes#ep25) of the American sitcom **[The Big Bang Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)** in 2008.

### Videos
Here is a YouTube video whereby you can see [Sheldon](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper) and [Raj](https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Rajesh_Koothrappali) settle a dispute about what to watch on TV using this game.

### Your opponent: Kool A.I.

In this version of the game,  the player will challenge the computer which goes by the name of **Kool A.I.**
<br>Each round, **Kool A.I.** will choose between two different strategies in an attempt to win.

# UX
## Target Audience

This online game targets all ages 5+.

*   Children 5+
*   Adults

## User Goals

* The game should be fun.
* The game should work on all relevant devices, that is, desktops, tablets and mobiles.

## User Stories

* As a user I want the game to be easy to learn and easy to play.
* The user has five choices: Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock.
* In each round, after the user has made their move, the computer opponent will respond with its own move.
* The game will keep the score and the number of rounds and display these figures accordingly.
* The user has the option to play again and again!


## Wireframes
* To design the wireframes I used [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/). 
The examples shown are between a mobile view and a desktop view.
For **tablets** the look would be practically the same as the desktop view; just that the sizes of the images and fonts are reduced.

* **Showing the User/Player beating the computer, namely, Kool A.I.**

The wireframes above reflect my initial approach of this project however as I continued development there has been significant changes to the initial look as shown below.

***
## Design Choice

I came across Anna Peterson's [article](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/the-worlds-easiest-the-rock-themed-rock-paper-scissors-javascript-tutorial-ee99b7f83e69) titled **The World’s Easiest “The Rock” Themed Rock Paper Scissors JavaScript Tutorial**<br>with the caption <em>If you’ve ever wanted Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson to teach you JavaScript, well, this isn’t your lucky day, but it is <strong>almost like</strong> your lucky day!</em><p>

I really liked her innovative approach so I have adapted the same approach.
That is, I looked for images and icons which would depict each of the five weapons for the game.

  For example :-
* For ***Rock***, Dwayne Johnson and Marvel Comics character, The Thing AKA Benjamin Jacob Grimm
* For ***Paper***, DC Comics Character Teen Titans [Paper](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Paper_(Teen_Titans_TV_Series))
* For ***Scissors***, Edgar Scissorhands and DC Comics Character Teen Titans [Scissors](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Scissors_(Teen_Titans_TV_Series))
* For ***Lizard***, Star Trek character Gorn and Marvel Comics character, The Lizard AKA Dr. Curtis "Curt" Connors
* For ***Spock***, actor Leonard Nimoy (1931-2015)

### Please note
Although I chose to use the same approach as shown by Peterson, nevertheless, besides 
1. using the ***defer tag*** has Peterson explained and 
2. my usage of her CSS initialisations

```
* {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

body {
  height: 100vh;
}

```

... **All the code in this project is mine!**

  
***
## How to Play

### The Form

At the onset the user is presented with a form whereby the user can **optionally** enter their name.<br>That is, it is not compulsory to enter one's name. It can be left blank.
<br>Then the user chooses the number of rounds. The choice being:
* 15 (the default)
* 10
* 5 or 
* a random number between 1 and 15 inclusive.

Then the user presses ***Let's Play!*** to begin the game.
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233741670-e4ea1763-4ffc-4df1-b1fa-ef63df971676.png)

### The Game

The user is prompted by the **YOUR MOVE!** prompt to choose between the five buttons <br>which correspond to the weapons, ***Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock.*** 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233741911-1fdaacb7-213b-4a90-89b4-49aa65021568.png)

  
Once the user makes their choice, the computer AKA ***Kool AI*** will respond with its choice of weapon.<br>
An image depicting the user's weapon choice is shown on the left; seconds later, an image of ***Kool AI***'s weapon choice is then shown on the right.<br><br>

The winner of that round is then determined and a message is shown to explain why the user ***either won or lost that round.***<br> 
Then a point is given to the victor. 

#### Game Play Examples
  
* In this round, ***Kool AI*** won because of its choice of **Spock**. **Spock** smashes the user's choice of **scissors**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233742390-88efe33c-361f-487c-a1cc-15121097bd0e.png)

* In this round, both the user and ***Kool AI*** tie because of their choice of **rock**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233742495-90d56ef1-3a05-47ee-9f39-9252ddfb5728.png)

* In this round, the user wins because the user chose **rock**. **Rock** crushes ***Kool AI***'s choice of **lizard**.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233742683-4d297670-ef76-4807-bb3f-979df5b36ce9.png)

* The number of rounds, the number of wins by the user, the number of wins by ***Kool AI*** and the number of ties are shown at the top.<br>

* The game ends when either the user or the computer gets to the predetermined number of rounds.<br> 

* The user can then choose to play ***Kool AI*** again by clicking the ***Play Again!*** button.
  
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233752898-d2bf2c07-8898-4db8-90fb-188594933d12.png)

* At any time, the user can choose to read the rules by clicking the rules button at the bottom of the page.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233779989-9f0ae49f-2081-4491-88f1-091d3f0b6550.png)


Please note: if the user had selected **random** for the number of rounds, then a **new** random number of rounds between 1 and 15 inclusive will be used for the next round.

### Player's Name
  
What follows are screenshots of a sample game session whereby the user had entered their name:<br>

* Please note: as one enters their name, the name is automatically converted to ***Title case***. That is, each separate word is capitalised whilst the rest of the letters are in lowercase. 
  
* ***Title case*** is also used to display the player's name when the game begins.

### Mathematics determines the winner

Modulo-5, that is, the remainder after dividing an integer by five, is used to determine the winner of each round.<br>
Each weapon has been assigned the following values:<br>
* ROCK = 0
* PAPER = 1
* SCISSORS = 2
* SPOCK = 3
* LIZARD = 4
  
<br>**Note: the different order of the last two moves is significant.**<br>To quote [HandWiki's Rock–Paper–Scissors entry](https://handwiki.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors)<br><br>
  > Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard (note the different order of the last two moves) may be modeled as a game in which each player picks a number from one to five. Subtract the number chosen by player two from the number chosen by player one, and then take the remainder modulo 5 of the result. 
**Player one is the victor if the difference is one or three**, and ***player two is the victor if the difference is two or four.*** If the difference is zero, the game is a tie.<br><br>
Alternatively, the rankings in Rock-Paper-Scissors-Spock-Lizard may be modeled by a comparison of the parity of the two choices. 
If it is the same **(two odd-numbered moves or two even-numbered ones)** then the lower number wins, while if they are different ***(one odd and one even) the higher wins.***
  
Therefore, mathematics is being used to determine the winner. I have chosen the first scenario, that is, subtracting the remainder modulo 5 of the two weapons used. 
However, instead of numbering the weapons 1 to 5, I have numbered them 0 to 4.<br>
To demonstrate - **Player one being the User** and ***Player two being the Computer***:
  
  ```
    If User played 0 (Rock) and Computer played 1 (Paper)
    then 0-1 = -1 
    -1 + 5 = 4 (added 5 because it was a negative number)
    Since 4 is even, Computer wins - User loses
    Indeed, Paper covers Rock!
    
    If User played 4 (Lizard) and Computer played 1 (Paper)
    then 4-1 = 3
    Since 3 is odd, User wins - Computer loses
    Indeed, Lizard eats Paper!
 ```

### Orientation Change

Although I employed responsive design when creating this game, it is still intended to operate in portrait mode.<br>Therefore, when used on a device which has a height in landscape mode less than that of a Nest Hub, that is, <br>600 pixels; an alert message will be displayed prompting the user to use the device in portrait mode.<br>

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/235243596-bfa014ac-0d41-4ffc-b29b-5ffbcc5d6c1f.png)

***
### Kool A.I. uses Two Strategies 

Whilst developing this game I went with simply choosing a random number between 0 and 4 inclusive to determine the weapon choice:
```
   function determineComputerChoice() {
      /* 
            For now, simply use a random number between 0-4 inclusive
      */
      return hand_weapons[Math.floor(Math.random() * 5)];
   }
```

Once the game was up and running I added two strategies for the computer to use when playing against the user.<br>
At the beginning of each game i.e. ***starting from round 0***; either number 1 or number 2 is selected randomly;<br>then that is ***the strategy number*** that the computer uses for that game.

#### Strategy 1 - Weighted Random Choices

* Assign each weapon a unique number: **ROCK=0, PAPER=1, SCISSORS=2, SPOCK=3, LIZARD=4**
* Each of the five weapons would start of with a equal weight of 1
* The ***weaponWeights*** array would look like this [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

* So when the computer AKA Kool AI, is about to choose a weapon the following algorithm is followed:
  
1. Add up all the weights e.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 - call it ***'total'***
2. Produce a random number less than one - call it ***'randomNumber'***
3. Then loop through the ***weaponWeights*** array as follows:

***Pseudocode:***

```
sum=0
for (i=0; i < weaponWeights.length - 1; i++)
{
        sum = sum + weaponWeights[i] / total
        if randomNumber < sum
              return i
        end if
}
return weaponWeights.length - 1
```

The value returned would be used to select the computer's choice of weapon<br>
            
Effectively, the above algorithm is choosing between 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5 i.e. 1<br>
if sum < 1/5 return 0 i.e. ROCK<br>
else if sum < 2/5 return 1 i.e. PAPER<br>
else if sum < 3/5 return 2 i.e. SCISSORS<br>
else if sum < 4/5 return 3 i.e. SPOCK<br>
else return 4 i.e. LIZARD
<br><br>
First time round, the chances of each weapon being chosen are ***evenly distributed;*** each has a value of 1/5 i.e. 0.2.

Now if Kool AI happens to win that round, for example, with its choice of SPOCK, then these steps will follow:

* Add 1 to the SPOCK value in the ***weaponWeights*** array
* So ***weaponWeights*** becomes [1, 1, 1, **2**, 1]

So then, the next time the above algorithm is executed, **total** is calculated as 1+1+1+2+1=6<br>
Effectively, a random number then must be chosen from 1/6, 2/6, 3/6, 5/6, 6/6<br>
The range that is ***> 3/6 and <= 5/6*** is larger than the other ranges, therefore there is a ***greater chance*** that ROCK will be selected again.<br>
So conclusively for **Strategy 1**, this algorithm is used for each of Kool AI's winning choice.<br>
In doing so, the computer's winning choices will have a greater possibility of being chosen for the next round.

 ***
 #### Strategy 2 - Heuristics in Decision Theory
  
There is a branch of science known as game theory.<br>
Game theory researchers have been trying to figure out a winning strategy for the typical rock-paper-scissors game, and have come up with intriguing results.<br>
To quote this article titled [How To Use Science To Win At Rock-Paper-Scissors?](https://streetscience.net/how-to-use-science-to-win-at-rock-paper-scissors/)
  
> Having faced challenges with applying game theory, some Chinese researchers decided to conduct an experiment with 360 participants. They split the participants into groups of 6 and conducted a series of rock-paper-scissors games.<br>
They came up with two key empirical observations that didn't fit the theory of chance:<br>
>1. When **a player won** a round, more often than not, the player **chose the same winning element** for the next round.<br>
>2. When **a player lost** a round, more often than not, the player **chose to avoid the same losing element** for the next round.
  <br>...<br>
  >Based on the empirical observations, the researchers came up with 2 conditional responses, also known as <br>**[heuristics](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heuristic) in decision theory**.<br>
  After testing, they confirmed that the strategy performed better than game theory in maximizing win rates.
  
  <br>Based on these observations, the researchers came up with the following winning strategy <br>that performed better than the findings of game theory.<br>
  
  From [the above article](https://streetscience.net/how-to-use-science-to-win-at-rock-paper-scissors/), here is the winning strategy in the form of two [heuristics](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heuristic):<br>
  1. **If you win** using one element, for the next round, **go for whatever element your opponent just lost with** in the current round.
  2. **If you lose** using one element, for the next round, **go for whatever was not called by either of the players** in the current round.

Therefore, for **Strategy 2**, the above algorithm is used by Kool AI in determining which weapon it will use.<br>
  
As a reminder, each time, a new game is begun with Kool AI, i.e. ***starting from round 0***;<br>either number 1 or number 2 is selected randomly; then that is ***the strategy number*** that the computer uses for that game.

## Images

I choose to use three images of each weapon in order that for each round, the computer could randomly choose an image to depict both the user's choice of weapon and the computer's choice of weapon.
  
The fifteen images are as follows:

## Image Compression
It has been stated that ***"The optimal file size for website images should be no more than 200 KB to ensure fast loading times, as images have a significant impact on site speed."***
<br>
In light of these facts: 
1. I used [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the sizes of **'spock1.png, spock3.png, scissors1.png and rock2_dwayne.png'**<br>so that they are less than 200 KB.
2. I used [Shutterstock Image Resizer](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-resizer) to compress the sizes of **'rock1_dwayne.png and scissors2_daniil_onischenko_unsplash.jpg'**<br>so that they are less than 200 KB.

## Fonts

I went to Google Fonts for my choice of fonts. I decided to use **'Press Start 2P'** because I wanted the user to ***feel that they are playing against a computer.*** The font **'Press Start 2P'** in my opinion has that 80s computer game feel and look to it.

## Icon Buttons

For the buttons' choice of each weapon I spell out each weapon followed by ***an icon which depicts the hand shape***
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233748441-ff004337-1004-43ec-996a-0321bfcd968e.png)
The icons I sourced from [fontawesome.com (version 5.15.4](https://fontawesome.com/v5/search).
So, the five buttons have the form as follows: 
  ```
  1. Rock <i class="fas fa-hand-rock"></i>
  2. Paper <i class="fas fa-hand-paper"></i>
  3. Scissors <i class="fas fa-hand-scissors"></i>
  4. Lizard <i class="fas fa-hand-lizard"></i>
  5. Spock <i class="fas fa-hand-spock"></i>
  ```
  
## Colours

* For the background I use a ***black*** linear-gradient(360deg, #1C1C1C 10%, #494949 360%) for the main background colour.

## Bugs

### Script kept on running even after throwing an error!

It was my understanding that if **an error is thrown and there is no catch** the error will be console.logged as ***Uncaught*** with a corresponding message.
After which the script would stop. However, this was not my experience whilst developing this game.<br>
That is, I had ***error-handling*** code in place in case of any errors. This code worked and indeed pointed out a logic error in my program.
The error handling code was as follows:

```
     if (!imageCharacter || imageIndices[imageCharacter] === undefined) {
         const errorMessage = `Unknown image info: ${imageInfo}`;
         alert(errorMessage);
         throw `${errorMessage}. Aborting!`;
      }
```
However although the error was indeed being shown in the console.log

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91061592/233799369-0ecf85ec-e112-432e-abe3-4b90f3776543.png)

Yet my script kept on running expecting the player's next game move!<br>
It was my understanding that JavaScript was **meant to stop** when an error occurs!<br>

Whilst investigating the matter I came across [this quote](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/324992/unlike-c-why-does-uncaught-exception-in-javascript-not-terminate-the-script)

> An uncaught exception in a ***Javascript script <strong>does</strong> cause the script to be terminated***, but the browser executing the script **does not remember that it terminated abnormally.**

So in effect, that is what was happening with my script. The browser (in my case, Chrome) kept on executing the script therefore the game kept running expecting the player's next move!

### Solution: Window: error event

I looked at this [Window: error event information](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/error_event) and thereby implemented an error handling routine:

```
window.addEventListener("error", (event) => {
   // Remove everything from the DOM's body
...
const newDiv = document.createElement("div");
   newDiv.innerHTML = "<h1>An Internal Error Has Occurred:</h1>";

   // Create element for the error message
   let errorMessage = document.createElement("h2");
   errorMessage.innerText = event.message;

   // Add the message to the newly created div
   newDiv.appendChild(errorMessage);
...
   // Display the error on the webpage
   bodyElement.appendChild(newDiv);

});

```

Now if any error occurs the entire webpage is cleared and a central error message is displayed.

## Jshint warnings

In order to remove warnings such as:<br>
* **'arrow function syntax (=>)' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')**
* **'template literal syntax' is only available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6')**
<br><br>Solution: I had to<br>
* Unclick ***New JavaScript features (ES6)***
* Then add <strong>/*jshint esversion: 6 */</strong> to the top of my script


Then I got the warning:<br>
* **'nullish coalescing' is only available in ES11 (use 'esversion: 11')**
<br><br>Solution: I had to<br>
* replace the /* jshint esversion: 6 */ comment with 
* <strong>/* jshint esversion: 11 */</strong>

## Jshint 'Confusing Semantics' warning

Jshint produced the following warning:<br>
**Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics.**<br>
***(showThisImage, determineComputerChoice, updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction)***<br><br>
Strictly speaking, this is ***a warning not an error!***
<br>Nevertheless I tried to remove it.
The warning was due to the following code:

```
      buttonsList[i].addEventListener("click", function () {
         showThisImage(weaponValues);
         const computerWeaponValue = determineComputerChoice();
         showThisImage(computerWeaponValue);
         updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction(weaponValues, computerWeaponValue);
      });
```


I tried using the editor 'Refactor' functionality 

```
      buttonsList[i].addEventListener("click", function () {
         addListenerToButton(showThisImage, weaponValues, determineComputerChoice, updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction);
      });


followed by

   function addListenerToButton(showThisImage, weaponValues, determineComputerChoice, updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction) {
            showThisImage(weaponValues);
            const computerWeaponValue = determineComputerChoice();
            showThisImage(computerWeaponValue);
            updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction(weaponValues, computerWeaponValue);
   }

```

This produced the same warning i.e.<br>
**Functions declared within loops referencing an outer scoped variable may lead to confusing semantics.**<br> 
***(addFunctionToButton, showThisImage, determineComputerChoice, updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction)***

### Solution: Use a Closure

I found the following example of a Closure solution in this article<br>
[JavaScript closure inside loops – simple practical example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/750486/javascript-closure-inside-loops-simple-practical-example)

```
    const funcs = [];
    function createfunc(i) {
        return function() {
          console.log("My value: " + i);
        };
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        funcs[i] = createfunc(i);
    }
```

Thus individual functions were being created with the ***closured current values of 'i'*** then placed in an array.<br>
I needed to do something similar with ***the current values of 'weaponValues'*** in my script.<br>
So that the resultant ***listener*** functions would thereby be added to each of the relevant five weapon-depicting buttons.<br>
The result I came up with was:

```

      let newListener = createListener(showThisImage,weaponValues);
      buttonsList[i].addEventListener("click", newListener);

      followed by

      function createListener(showThisImage, weaponValues) {
          return function () {
              showThisImage(weaponValues);
              const computerWeaponValue = determineComputerChoice();
              showThisImage(computerWeaponValue);
              updateScoresThenDetermineNextAction(weaponValues, computerWeaponValue);
          };
      }      
```

The above changes successfully removed the Jshint warning.

## Future features
* Alongside the option to ***Play Again!***, I would like to add a Home button so that the user can enter a new selection of rounds or even another name for another player
* It would be great to have sound effects that play when a move is made
